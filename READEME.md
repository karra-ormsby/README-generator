## Description

Given some initial code, I have created a command line application that when run, will generate a README based on the users answers to questions that are generated on the command line. The questions follow the [Professional README guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) principles to ensure that a high-quality and professional README will be generated.

Then type "npm init -y" and then "npm intall inquirer@8..2.4"
